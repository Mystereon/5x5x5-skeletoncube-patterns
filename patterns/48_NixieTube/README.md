# 48_NixieTube — Nixie Tube

Dull orange inactive tube segments and bright orange 0–9 numerals.

This is a **fully standalone, directly uploadable** Arduino FastLED sketch. It
contains its own 5×5×5 mapper, all supporting code, `setup()`, and `loop()`.
There is no browser-controller, master-sketch, or local-header dependency.
